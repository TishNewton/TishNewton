👋 Hi there, I’m Oluwatise

💻 Junior Python Developer | 🔋 Economic Dispatch Researcher | 📐 Julia Programmer | Electrical Engineer


**🧑‍💻 About Me**

I’m a curious and motivated developer who enjoys building things with Python and exploring optimization problems in power systems.
I split my time between writing Python code (for backend, automation, and small projects) and researching Economic Dispatch Problems using Julia.

My goal is to grow as a software developer while contributing to research that makes real-world systems more efficient.

⚡ Skills & Technologies

* Python (backend scripts, automation, small projects)

* Julia (optimization, convex programming, research workflows)

* Optimization & Research (economic dispatch, convex methods, prohibited operating zones)


🔧 Tools: Git, VS Code, Jupyter, JuMP

🔬 Current Work / Research

Right now, I’m focused on:

Studying and solving the Economic Dispatch Problem (EDP) with constraints such as Prohibited Operating Zones (POZ).

Using convex optimization techniques and Julia (JuMP, TSSOS) to test and improve solution methods.

Exploring the balance between certified lower bounds (SDP relaxations) and feasible upper bounds (heuristics) in dispatch problems.

Working on Python projects like(REST API for a job-tracker, automated data analysis pipelines with pandas)

🌱 **Learning & Growth**

I’m currently learning and improving in:

⚙️ Advanced Julia optimization techniques

🐍 New Python frameworks for backend development

📚 Deepening my understanding of convex optimization and energy systems
